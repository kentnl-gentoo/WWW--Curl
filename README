README for Perl extension WWW::Curl::easy.

The perl module WWW::Curl::easy provides an interface to the cURL library "libcurl".
See http://curl.haxx.se/ for more information on cURL and libcurl.

This module requires libcurl and the corresponding headerfiles to be
installed. You then may install this module via the usual way:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test # see note below
    make install

The Makefile.PL script will try to use the 'curl-config' command to find
the correct headers and libcurl path. If curl.h can't be found,
either through curl-config or the internal list of guesses, you can specify
an explicit path when building the Makefile:

    perl Makefile.PL /home/foo/curl/include

The maintainer has never tried to run this on windows, so all feedback welcome.

Testing:
 
'make test' will only run if you have a suitable test web server somewhere - 
the 'printenv' script commonly distributed with apache on linux is useable, for
example.  You need to set the environment variable CURL_TEST_URL to the URL
of such a script for 'make test' to work automatically.

Test 08ssl.t will only work properly if you have a list of well
known CA certificates in the file 'ca-bundle.crt' in the current directory.
This file can be obtained from most distributions of mod_ssl (www.modssl.org) -
it isn't supplied here, as its currently >250Kbytes.

The module provides the same functionality as libcurl provides to C programs,
please refer to the documentation of libcurl. A number of examples may be
found in t/*.t and examples/ directories.
